Healthcare accessibility is a critical aspect of urban life, but patients often struggle to find nearby doctors with the right specialization and availability. DocHunt is a proposed web-based application built using React (with Bootstrap) for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The system will allow users to search for doctors in their area, view profiles with specializations, ratings, and availability, and book appointments online.--Sakshi

Build a user-friendly web application using React + Bootstrap.
Implement a RESTful API backend using Spring Boot to handle data storage, authentication, and booking logic.
Integrate location-based doctor search and specialization filters.
Allow users to book appointments online and view doctor availability.
Enable users to leave ratings/reviews for doctors.

4. Features
User Authentication – Secure login/signup for patients and doctors.
Doctor Profiles – Display specialization, experience, availability, and ratings
Search & Filter – Location-based search with filters for specialization and availability.
